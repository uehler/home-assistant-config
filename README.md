This is the config of my smart home

It is running on a Raspberry 1 B with Home Assistant as platform

Right now my smart home isn't that smart.
I am using [4 LimitlessLEDs](http://amzn.to/2nsZJ8Z) for illumination and there is a simple automation which switches them on when I wake up on weekdays.

Next step is an automation which turns the lights on when I come home in the evening
